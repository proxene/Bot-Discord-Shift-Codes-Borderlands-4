**Last updated: 23 September 2025**

## 1. Introduction
The Borderlands 4 SHiFT Bot ("Bot") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and your rights regarding your data when using the Bot.

<br>

## 2. Information Collected
When you use the Bot, the following information may be collected:

- **Server Information**: Server ID, configured channel ID, language preferences. This data is used to deliver SHiFT codes to the correct channel and in the selected language.
- **Bot Usage Data**: Commands used, timestamps, errors. This data helps improve the Bot and fix bugs.
- **SHiFT Codes**: Codes retrieved from public sources are temporarily stored to notify users of new codes.

No personally identifiable information, such as email addresses or IP addresses, is stored permanently.

<br>

## 3. Use of Information
Collected information is used solely to provide and maintain the Bot's features:

- Sending SHiFT codes to configured channels.
- Managing server language and configuration settings.
- Debugging and improving Bot performance.

<br>

## 4. Data Sharing
The Bot **does not sell or share** your server information with third parties. Publicly available SHiFT codes are only collected to inform users.

<br>

## 5. Data Retention
- Configuration data (server, channel, language) is retained as long as the server uses the Bot.
- Old SHiFT codes are stored to prevent sending duplicate notifications.
- Data can be deleted at any time by removing the Bot from your server.

<br>

## 6. Security
Reasonable measures are taken to protect your data. Access to configuration files is limited to the Bot's runtime environment.

<br>

## 7. Compliance with Discord
The Bot complies with [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy). Any violation of Discord rules may result in suspension of Bot access for the affected server.
